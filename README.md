- E-commerce platforms face numerous challenges in optimizing their operations, understanding
customer behavior, and maximizing profitability. This project aims to leverage data analysis
techniques to gain insights into various aspects of an e-commerce business, including sales
trends, customer segmentation, inventory management, and pricing strategies. The goal is to develop a comprehensive analysis framework that can help e-commerce
businesses make data-driven decisions to improve their performance, enhance customer
satisfaction, and increase revenue.
